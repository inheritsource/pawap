    <description>
      Please use this service type to request the removal of a dead or badly damaged tree from public space. DDOT's Urban Forestry Administration (UFA) removes trees that are dead, dying/diseased, or unsafe (those that have structural and/or dangerous root defects which cannot be corrected). Once a tree is inspected by an arborist, the arborist will determine what measures should be taken in regard to the tree in question. <br><br>In the event of an emergency, such as broken or hanging limbs, or a tree is down blocking the flow of traffic or obscuring the view of a stop sign or other traffic sign, the DDOT's Urban Forestry Division will respond to mitigate the issue.<br>
